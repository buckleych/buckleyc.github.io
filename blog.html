    <h2>4/8/20 Assignment 1 </h2>
      <p>My biggest challenge for this assignment was the logistics of 
      using GitHub, Visual Studio, and publishing the website. I was 
      also having issues preview the html files which I still need to fix.</p>
      <p>Overall I've learned what Git is and how to use GitHub effectively. I already
      knew a little bit of html, however, I had yet to publish anything. I was able to 
      learn how to effectively use these tools through the lecture notes, piazza, and many 
      google searches.</p>
