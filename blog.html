    <h2>4/8/20 Assignment 1 </h2>
      <p>My biggest challenge for this assignment was the logistics of 
      using GitHub, Visual Studio, and publishing the website. I was 
      also having issues preview the html files which I still need to fix.</p>
      <p>Overall I've learned what Git is and how to use GitHub effectively. I already
      knew a little bit of html, however, I had yet to publish anything. I was able to 
      learn how to effectively use these tools through the lecture notes, piazza, and many 
      google searches.</p>
    
    <h2>4/27/19</h2>
    <p> My bigggest challenge for this assignment was actually just positioning different elements.
      I belive this probably stemmed from a lack of understanding of the structure rather than how
      to move elements. Most certain objects had attributes which were blocking me from moving them.
      I definitely learned a lot about CSS in this assignment, its been a while since I used it. 
      I actually foud the piazza post on flex boxes the most helpful for formating my assignment. 
      However, I also googled small things like how to remove underlines and change link stylings.
